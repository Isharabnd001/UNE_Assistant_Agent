# Responsible AI Multi Agent UNE Support Bot

This project is a responsible AI Multi Agent chatbot designed to assist students and staff at the **University of New England (UNE)** in **Armidale, Australia**. It uses **OpenAI Agents SDK** to enable multi-agent LLM orchestration for course related advices, poetry generation on life at UNE, and schedule inquiries on classes at UNE.

> **Note:** We use the **OpenAI Agents SDK** as **OpenAI Swarms framework is deprecated and has been replaced by Open AI Agents SDK**.
